### Version 1: Value-Focused

```
🚀 From Idea to App in Hours, Not Weeks

As an AI Lead, I've seen firsthand how AI-powered coding is transforming software development. 

But here's what surprised me: Most developers aren't using these tools to their full potential.

That's why I'm launching AI 101: Vibe Coding for Software Developers.

This isn't another "AI will replace developers" course. It's practical training on:

✅ Building full-stack apps 10x faster
✅ Turning ideas into deployed applications
✅ Using GitHub Copilot & Cursor effectively
✅ Knowing when to use AI vs manual coding
✅ Production-ready development workflows

Real projects. Real code. Real results.

After 20+ years architecting scalable applications and leading engineering teams, I'm distilling what actually works into a hands-on course.

No fluff. Just practical techniques you can use tomorrow.

### Version 2: Story-Driven

```
Remember when we thought Stack Overflow was cheating?

Now we have AI assistants writing entire functions.

The game has changed. Again.

I spent the last year helping developers integrate AI into their workflows. Here's what I learned:

The best developers aren't fighting AI. They're learning to dance with it.

They're building apps in days that used to take months.
They're shipping features while their coffee's still hot.
They're focusing on architecture while AI handles boilerplate.

But there's a gap - between knowing AI exists and using it effectively.

That's what AI 101: Vibe Coding for Software Developers solves.

💡 Not theory. Real builds.
💡 Not toy projects. Production apps.
💡 Not "AI will replace you." AI will accelerate you.

Learn to transform ideas into deployed applications. Fast.

The future of development isn't AI replacing developers.
It's developers with AI replacing developers without AI.

Where do you want to be?

Title: [Course] AI 101: Vibe Coding for Software Developers - Learn to Build Apps 10x Faster

Hey r/learnprogramming!

I'm Madhusudhan Konda, an AI Lead with 20+ years in software development. I've created a practical course on building applications using AI-powered coding tools.

**What's different:**
- Not about building AI models - it's about using AI tools to CODE faster
- Hands-on projects (actually build full-stack apps)
- Learn GitHub Copilot, Cursor AI, ChatGPT for development
- From idea → deployed app in hours

**Who it's for:**
- Developers who want to build faster
- Anyone curious about AI-assisted coding
- People with an idea but limited time

**What you'll build:**
Real applications with databases, APIs, frontends, and deployment.

The goal isn't to replace your skills - it's to 10x them.

Course info: https://madhusudhankonda.github.io/ai/

Happy to answer questions! AMA about AI-assisted development.

Title: Using AI Tools to Build Full-Stack Apps: My Experience Teaching Developers

After a year helping developers integrate AI into their workflows, I noticed a pattern:

**What doesn't work:**
- Blindly accepting AI suggestions
- Using it for everything
- Ignoring fundamentals

**What does work:**
- AI for boilerplate, humans for architecture
- Understanding the generated code
- Knowing when to code manually

I created AI 101: Vibe Coding to teach the practical side - not the hype.

Real builds. Production-ready code. Knowing when AI helps vs when it hurts.

Curious what others have found: What's your best use case for AI coding tools? What's been overhyped?

Title: Building full-stack apps in hours with AI-assisted coding [Course Launch]

Hey r/webdev,

I'm launching a course on practical AI-assisted development.

**The premise:** Use AI tools to go from idea → deployed app fast.

**The reality:** It works, but you need to know how.

Covers:
- GitHub Copilot & Cursor for frontend/backend
- Building REST APIs with AI assistance
- Database design with AI help
- When AI accelerates vs when it slows you down
- Deployment and production considerations

Not about prompt engineering or building chatbots. About building real web apps faster.

Course: https://madhusudhankonda.github.io/ai/

Stack: Python/JS, React, Node.js, PostgreSQL - but concepts apply to any stack.

Questions welcome!

## Twitter/X Thread

```
Tweet 1:
Building apps with AI coding tools is like having a junior dev who:
- Writes code instantly
- Never gets tired
- Sometimes hallucinates functions that don't exist
- Needs your review on everything

Here's what I learned helping developers use AI effectively 🧵

Tweet 2:
The best use case? Boilerplate code.

CRUD operations, API routes, database schemas, test setup - things you've done 100 times.

AI excels at "I know what I want, I just don't want to type it."

Tweet 3:
The worst use case? Complex business logic.

AI doesn't understand your domain.
It doesn't know your edge cases.
It can't read your team's minds.

Use AI for the "how."
You provide the "what" and "why."

Tweet 4:
Real talk: AI won't replace developers.

But developers using AI will replace developers not using AI.

The skill isn't "prompting."
The skill is knowing when to use AI vs when to think.

Tweet 5:
I built a course teaching this: https://madhusudhankonda.github.io/ai/

Not theory. Real apps. Production-ready code.

From idea to deployed in hours.

Title: AI 101: Vibe Coding for Software Developers – Building Apps with AI Tools

URL: https://madhusudhankonda.github.io/ai/

I'm an AI Lead who spent the last year helping developers integrate AI coding tools into their workflows.

Common pattern: People know GitHub Copilot exists but don't use it effectively.

This course covers practical AI-assisted development:
- When AI accelerates (boilerplate, tests, docs)
- When AI slows down (complex logic, architecture)  
- Building full-stack apps with AI assistance
- Production deployment considerations
- Knowing when to code manually

Focus: Real builds, not prompt engineering theory.

Happy to discuss what actually works with these tools vs what's overhyped.

## Dev.to Article Snippet

```
Title: From Idea to Deployed App in Hours: AI-Assisted Development

I've been teaching developers to use AI coding tools effectively. Here's what works:

**The Good:**
- Boilerplate generation (80% time saved)
- Test writing (finally, no excuses)
- Documentation (AI actually likes writing docs)
- API routes (repetitive tasks = AI gold)

**The Bad:**
- Complex business logic (AI doesn't know your domain)
- Architecture decisions (need human judgment)
- Security-critical code (always review!)
- Performance optimization (AI suggests naive solutions)

**The Process:**
1. Describe what you want (human)
2. Generate the code (AI)
3. Review and refine (human)
4. Test thoroughly (AI + human)
5. Deploy (human)
